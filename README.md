# 42 School - Core Curriculum: First Projects

![42 Logo](https://42.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/42-Final-sigle-seul.svg)

This repository contains my first three projects completed during the initial phase of my journey at 42 School (April-May 2024). These foundational projects establish the core programming skills needed for the rest of the curriculum.

## Projects Overview

### [Libft](./01_libft)
**My First C Library**

A custom implementation of various standard C library functions, creating a personal toolbox for future projects.

- **Key Components**: Character checks, string manipulation, memory management, linked lists
- **Skills Developed**: Low-level programming, memory allocation, data structures
- **Project Goal**: Understand how standard library functions work by rebuilding them from scratch

### [ft_printf](./02_ft_printf)
**Custom Printf Implementation**

A recoded version of the standard C printf function, handling various format specifiers.

- **Conversions Handled**: %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %%
- **Skills Developed**: Variadic functions, string formatting, type conversion
- **Project Goal**: Create a versatile function for formatted output that mimics libc's printf

### [Get Next Line](./03_get_next_line)
**Reading Line by Line from File Descriptors**

A function that returns a line read from a file descriptor, handling one line at a time.

- **Key Features**: Works with files and standard input, preserves reading position between calls
- **Skills Developed**: Static variables, file operations, buffer management
- **Project Goal**: Create an efficient tool for line-by-line file processing

## Learning Journey

Each project builds upon skills from the previous one, gradually introducing more complex programming concepts while reinforcing fundamentals.

## Usage

Each project directory contains its own README with specific instructions for compilation and usage.
